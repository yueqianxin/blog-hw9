**Predicting Income Levels from Census Data**

Income affects nearly every aspect of a person's living condition, such as the place they live, the opportunities they can have, and even how much free time they have. However, what actually influence someone's earning? To explore this question, I used a U.S. census dataset, which contains roughly 48,000 individuals, to investigate this problem. The dataset contains demographic and employment-related features such as age, education level, occupation, marital status, weekly and working hours. My goal was not to build the most complicated model, but simply to examine what features can be used to predict whether a person earning more then 50K per year 

Exploring the Data
Before building any models, I wanted to understand what kinds of patterns existed in the data. After visualizing the data, some relationships are revealed. For instance, figure 1 shows that most of people who have income more than 50k are the people who work more hours per week. It can be observed from the figure that people who earn more than 50k rarely have a low work hours per week. However, the trend is not linear. Most of high income people works around 30 to 40 hours per week, but the extreme work hours tends to reduce the number of people who have high income.
